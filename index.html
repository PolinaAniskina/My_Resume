        <p>Yes, that's me in the photo above, haha</p>
        <p>I'm just at the beginning of this journey, but...</p>
        <p>Let's go through it together!</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Let me tell you about me first</h2>
        <h3>My Education and Experience:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First of all, I graduated from school.</p>
                <p>I was a winner of some school contests related to programming, 
                   and I'm still proud of it!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>But then something happened and I decided to become an artist.</p>
                <p>It was really difficult... But look at my art!</p>
                <a href="https://www.artstation.com/phobic_paul">You can take a look here</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>And now I do two things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I study Architecture and Interior Design in university</li>
                    <li>I'm taking an online course about web-development!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <hr />
        <p>As you may have noticed, this web page is not really stylish. That's because I used only HTML.</p>
        <p>I wasn't lying when I said "I'm at the beginning".</p>
        <h3>But by the way, there are other pages there:</h3>
        <a href="./public/Hobbies.html">Small list of my hobbies</a>
        <p>And </p>
        <a href="./public/contact.html">My Contacts</a>
        <h3>Thanks for the attention!</h3>
        <footer>
